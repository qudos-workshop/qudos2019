**NEWS! We are honored to inform you that esteemed Prof. Dr. Ian Gorton will deliver our morning [Keynote on "Engineering at Hyperscale - Architectural Issues and Challenges]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link program.md %})".**

<<<<<<< HEAD
<b>Abstract</b>. It seems difficult to believe that Web sites such as Youtube.com
(debuted in November 2005) and Facebook.com (public access in 2006) have
been around for barely a decade. In 2015 Youtube had more than a billion
users, who watched 4 billion videos per day and uploaded 300 hours of
video per minute. In 2009, Facebook stored 15 billion photos, occupying
1.5 petabytes (PBs) and at that time growing at a rate of 30 million
photos per day. In 2015, Facebook users uploaded 2 billion photos each
day, requiring 40 PB of new disk capacity daily. Recently it was
reported that Google’s code base contained 2 billion LoC.

Traffic and storage magnitudes and code complexities  such as these will
only grow in the future., as in terms of rate of growth, Youtube and
Facebook are by no means unique. With the imminent explosion of the
Internet of Things – up to 50 billion new devices are forecast by 2020-
the scale of the systems we build to capture, analyze and exploit this
ballooning data will continue to grow exponentially. We refer to these
systems as hyper scalable systems

Experience building hyper scalable systems has clearly demonstrated that
requirements for extreme scale challenge and break many dearly held
tenets of software engineering. For example, hyper scale systems cannot
be thoroughly system tested before deployment due to their scale and
need to run 24×7. Hence new, innovative engineering approaches must be
adopted to enable systems to rapidly scale at a pace that keeps up with
business and functional requirements, and at acceptable, predictable costs

This talk is about engineering systems at hyperscale. It briefly
describes the characteristics of hyperscale systems, and some of the
core principles that are necessary to ensure hyperscalability. These
principles are illustrated by state of the art approaches and
technologies that are used to in continuous development for
hyperscalable systems.

The QUDOS workshop provides a forum for experts from academia and industry to present and discuss novel quality-aware methods, practices and tools for DevOps.

DevOps extends the agile development principles to include the full stack of software services, from design to execution, enabling and promoting collaboration of operations, quality assurance, and development engineers throughout the entire service lifecycle. Ultimately, DevOps is a process that enables faster releases of a better product to the end user. DevOps encompasses a set of values, principles, methods, practices, and tools, to accelerate software delivery to the customer by means of infrastructure as code, continuous integration and deployment, automated testing and monitoring, or new architectural styles such as microservices. In the end all common software engineering activities, organizational forms and processes have to be questioned, adapted and extended to ensure continuous and unobstructed software development, this is the aim of continuous software engineering (CSE)research. Current software engineering research mainly deals with the development aspects of DevOps and CSE, focusing on development methods, practices, and tools, leaving the quality assurance aspects of DevOps behind.

Even though development practices such as testing (at all levels) are instrumental in producing quality software, they mostly deal with the functional correctness, while quality assurance deals with a more broadly defined concept of quality, of which functional correctness is just one dimension. However, DevOps needs methods and tools that enable systematic assessment, prediction, and management of software quality in other dimensions as well, including performance, reliability, safety, survivability, or cost of ownership.

The QUDOS workshop provides a forum for experts from academia and industry to present and discuss novel quality-aware methods, practices and tools for DevOps. On the other hand, the goal of the CSE workshop is to present and discuss innovative solutions, ideas and experiences in the area of continuity along the entire software engineering lifecycle hence, Continuous Software Engineering. 

QUDOS 2019 is technically sponsored by the Research Group (RG) and the [RG DevOps Performance Working Group](https://research.spec.org/devopswg) of the [Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC RG)](http://research.spec.org/), and by the consortium of the EU project RADON. The workshop is supported by the [IFIP Working Group on Service Oriented Systems](http://ifip-wg-sos.deib.polimi.it/), and by the [DFG Priority Programme 1593 (SPP1593) "Design For Future - Managed Software Evolution"](http://www.dfg-spp1593.de/), funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).
