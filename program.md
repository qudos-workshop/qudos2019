<b>Abstract</b>. It seems difficult to believe that Web sites such as Youtube.com
(debuted in November 2005) and Facebook.com (public access in 2006) have
been around for barely a decade. In 2015 Youtube had more than a billion
users, who watched 4 billion videos per day and uploaded 300 hours of
video per minute. In 2009, Facebook stored 15 billion photos, occupying
1.5 petabytes (PBs) and at that time growing at a rate of 30 million
photos per day. In 2015, Facebook users uploaded 2 billion photos each
day, requiring 40 PB of new disk capacity daily. Recently it was
reported that Google’s code base contained 2 billion LoC.

Traffic and storage magnitudes and code complexities  such as these will
only grow in the future., as in terms of rate of growth, Youtube and
Facebook are by no means unique. With the imminent explosion of the
Internet of Things – up to 50 billion new devices are forecast by 2020-
the scale of the systems we build to capture, analyze and exploit this
ballooning data will continue to grow exponentially. We refer to these
systems as hyper scalable systems

Experience building hyper scalable systems has clearly demonstrated that
requirements for extreme scale challenge and break many dearly held
tenets of software engineering. For example, hyper scale systems cannot
be thoroughly system tested before deployment due to their scale and
need to run 24×7. Hence new, innovative engineering approaches must be
adopted to enable systems to rapidly scale at a pace that keeps up with
business and functional requirements, and at acceptable, predictable costs

This talk is about engineering systems at hyperscale. It briefly
describes the characteristics of hyperscale systems, and some of the
core principles that are necessary to ensure hyperscalability. These
principles are illustrated by state of the art approaches and
technologies that are used to in continuous development for
hyperscalable systems.
